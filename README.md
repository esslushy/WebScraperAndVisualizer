# Web Scraper And Visualizer

This is the true final project of level 4 for Hello World. The goal of this project was to make a web scraper that would follow every link on a page and go to every other link that wasnt yet visited and collect the links on those pages until it visited every page on the site. Then it would store the data in a file to be read and then graphed by visualizer.py.

The class at this time was taught by Steve over the Summer. This was the final project to level 4 of NLP and NN with python by Hello World.
